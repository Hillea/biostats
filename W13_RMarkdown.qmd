# R Markdown

R scripts are a good way to save your code. However, you'd better heavily comment in your scripts, so that future you (and potentially collaborators) know what happens in your script.

An extension is an **R Markdown file**. This is also a sort of script, but the main focus is on writing text (like in a word processor) and mix it with code chunks, in which you can write your R code. R Markdown is the "language" you use to write in these files, which is a variety of the *Markdown* language.

The advantage of R Markdown files (ending with `.Rmd`), in comparison to Word or LaTeX files, is that they increase reproducibility. For example, you can (and will) write whole reports in R Markdown.

A newer variant is called *quarto*, which works very similar to R Markdown (but is more flexible). These slides are written with it.

**Assignment**:

-   Open a new .Rmd file, change/insert the title and author.

-   Check out the content of it.

-   Delete and add some of the text on the white background. Change the Header (indicated by `##`) to "About me" and write something about yourself underneath.

-   Switch between "Source" and "Visual" in the top left. What changes? What is "Visual"?

-   In the grey boxes ("code chunks"), add some code. Try to find out how you can add a new code chunk.

-   Save the file with a sensible name.

-   What happens when you click on "Knit" (top of Script pane)?

::: notes
-   hint: The green C with the + on the top right will do so (or using "insert" in the visual view)
-   Click on the little arrow next to knit and select "Knit to PDF"
-   insert inline code

There are many useful things you can do with R Markdown: Adding different headers, adding inline code, knitting as a PDF, adding pictures or tables...You can also decide whether the code chunks should be visible in the output etc.

**You will need R Markdown for your report!**
